# 🧪 Crewmind.ai – Technical Challenge

Thank you for your interest in the **Lead Fullstack Developer** position at Nexa Consulting.

This short technical challenge is designed to reflect a simplified version of what we are building: an intelligent assistant that interacts via a frontend, stores memory, and returns contextual responses.

---

## 📌 Objective

Build a minimal fullstack assistant that allows a user to ask a question, stores it, and returns a (simulated) response.

---

## 🧱 Requirements

You are free to structure the code however you prefer, but the following features are expected:

### 1. Frontend – React
- A simple page with a **text input** and a **"Send" button**
- When clicked, the input should be sent to the backend via API
- Display the **response** from the backend on the screen

### 2. Backend – FastAPI
- Receive the question sent from the frontend
- Store the question in a **MongoDB** collection (local or cloud-based)
- Return a fixed simulated response:  
  `"Thanks for your question, I’ll think about it."`

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack Required

- Frontend: **React (JS or TS)**
- Backend: **FastAPI (Python)**
- Database: **MongoDB**

---

## 🧠 Bonus (optional but appreciated)
- Instead of a fixed response, dynamically generate it (e.g., via a public LLM API, dummy prompt logic, or local inference)
- Add a timestamp to each stored question
- Add a second endpoint `/history` to return the full conversation

---

## 📤 Submission Instructions

- Upload your code to **GitHub** and share the **repository link**
- Include a clear and concise **README** with:
  - How to run the frontend and backend
  - Which technologies/libraries you used
  - Anything you'd do differently with more time
- (Optional) Record a short **Loom video** (max 3 min) explaining your thought process

---

## 📅 Deadline

Please submit your GitHub link in maximum 3 days time period.  
We’ll follow up shortly after reviewing your work.

---

## 🧭 Evaluation Criteria

We are not looking for perfection, but rather:
- Code clarity and structure
- Ability to use the right tools in the stack
- Autonomy and problem-solving approach
- Bonus: any sign of curiosity, creativity or care

Thank you again – we look forward to discovering your work!
